# [Open-Know-Where map of facilitites and machinery - Data Management Repository](https://map.internetofproduction.org/)

[The Open-Know-Where map of facilitites and machinery](https://map.internetofproduction.org/) is a map of facilities developed by the Internet of Production Alliance [IOPA](http://internetofproduction.org/).

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks designed for the collection and analysis of machinery and facilities data. The notebooks cover a range of topics, including data acquisition processes, machinery cataloging, and map visualization. These resources aim to provide comprehensive insights into the status and usability of machinery and facilities within a given context.
Installation Instructions

To run the Jupyter notebooks locally, follow these simple steps:
Prerequisites

Python:
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

Jupyter Notebooks:
Install Jupyter Notebooks using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash

pip install notebook```

Cloning the Repository

Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired directory. Then, clone the repository using:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/iop-alliance/okw_data_management.git```

Navigate to the Repository:

Move into the repository directory:

```bash

cd okw_data_management```

Running Jupyter Notebooks

Launch Jupyter:
Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command:

```bash

jupyter notebook```

Access Notebooks:
Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8888. You will see the Jupyter file browser.

Select a Notebook:
Navigate to the "notebooks" directory and open the desired notebook (e.g., data_count.ipynb).

Run the Notebook:
Run the notebook cells one by one to execute the code.

Additional Notes

Make sure to read any specific instructions or dependencies mentioned within individual notebooks.
