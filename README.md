# [Open-Know-Where map of facilitites and machinery - Data Management Repository](https://map.internetofproduction.org/)

[The Open-Know-Where map of facilitites and machinery](https://map.internetofproduction.org/) is a map of facilities developed by the Internet of Production Alliance [IOPA](http://internetofproduction.org/).

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks designed for the collection and analysis of machinery and facilities data. The notebooks cover a range of topics, including data acquisition processes, machinery cataloging, and map visualization. These resources aim to provide comprehensive insights into the status and usability of machinery and facilities enabling distributed manufacturing.

### Installation Instructions

To run the Jupyter notebooks locally, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

. Python:
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

. Jupyter Notebooks:
Install Jupyter Notebooks using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash

pip install notebook
```

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired directory. Then, clone the repository using:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/iop-alliance/okw_data_management.git
```

Navigate to the Repository:

Move into the repository directory:

```bash

cd okw_data_management
```

### Running Jupyter Notebooks

Launch Jupyter:
Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command:

```bash

jupyter notebook
```

Access Notebooks:
Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8888. You will see the Jupyter file browser.

Select a Notebook:
Navigate to the "notebooks" directory and open the desired notebook (e.g., data_count.ipynb).

### Run the Notebook:
Run the notebook cells one by one to execute the code.

### Additional Notes

Make sure to read any specific instructions or dependencies mentioned within individual notebooks.
